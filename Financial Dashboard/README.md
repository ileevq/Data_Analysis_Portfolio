### Information, Dataset and Dashboard
This is a financial analysis along with an interactive dashboard. I used [this](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18700758/Financial.Sample.xlsx) dataset provided by Microsoft.  
Below, you can find the file for download as well as the report with insights and recommendations.

## Insights
* The Government segment consistently showed strong sales over time, particularly in Q4-2013, Q1-2014 and Q4-2014.
* Midmarket sales spiked during mid-year, indicating potential seasonality.
* The Paseo product has the highest number of units sold, making it a strong revenue driver.
* Carretera has relatively lower units sold but maintains profitability due to its pricing.
* Canada, France, and the USA lead in total sales volume.
* Profitability is highest when discounting is minimized, suggesting that a pricing strategy adjustment could enhance margins.

## Recommendations
* **Optimize Pricing Strategies**: Products like Amarilla and VTT have strong sales but need better pricing structures to enhance profit margins. Reviewing supply chain and material costs could drive profitability.
* **Reduce Discounts in High-Selling Regions**: Since sales in Canada, France, and the USA are already strong, reducing discounts could increase revenue without affecting sales volume significantly.
* **Targeted Marketing for Midmarket Growth**: Since midmarket sales peak in mid-year, an advertising push in Q2 could maximize revenue.
* **Product Rationalization**: Discontinuation or repositioning of products with persistently low sales to free up resources.
* **Dynamic Pricing Models**: Experimenting with adjusting sale prices in response to demand trends.

 ## Tools and techniques
  * **Data cleaning** - I standardized data types, removed white spaces, and made the table more readable.
  * **Pivot Table** - I used them to extract the most important information, such as the number of units sold by segment and the profitability of products.
  * **Visualization** - I created an interactive dashboard that allows filtering by date, product type, and country, using pivot tables.
