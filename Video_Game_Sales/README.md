In this project, I took a dataset from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales) and decided to address several business questions created using AI. I will visualize the data at the end.\
Below, I will outline these business tasks, and at the very end, I will describe the files in this entire folder.
